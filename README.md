# TetraDetector
Repository for the STM32 Tetra Detector software
This uses a custom AD8313 based log measurer board with a saw filter from 380 to 400mhz
The hardware diagrams etc are not currently being made public at time of writing but that will change in the future

I do not consent for this software to be used for anything commercial without my explicit written consent
